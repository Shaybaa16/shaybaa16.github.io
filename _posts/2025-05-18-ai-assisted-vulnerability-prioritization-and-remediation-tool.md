##  Introduction

In todayâ€™s threat landscape, organizations face an increasing volume of vulnerabilities. Traditional vulnerability management methods are time-consuming and lack intelligent prioritization and automated remediation.

This project aims to build an AI-powered system that:
- Automates vulnerability scanning, classification, and remediation recommendation.
- Uses tools like **Nmap** and **OpenVAS** for scanning.
- Applies **NLP** and **Machine Learning** to classify and suggest fixes for vulnerabilities.

---

##  Project Objective

To develop an AI-assisted vulnerability management tool that:
- Automates identification, classification, and prioritization of vulnerabilities.
- Assigns severity levels.
- Recommends remediation steps using real-world data and AI.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Nmap**, **OpenVAS**
- **scikit-learn**
- **spaCy**, **NLTK**, **SBERT**, **T5**, **DistilBART**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **Streamlit**
- **VS Code**

---

##  Scope

Focus on detecting and analyzing network and OS vulnerabilities, integrating data from:
- NVD CVE feeds
- OpenVAS & Nmap scans
- Exploit-DB repositories

Uses AI to classify vulnerabilities and suggest remediation steps.

---

##  Methodology

###  Data Collection
- 5 years of CVE data from NVD JSON feeds.
- Parsed OpenVAS & Nmap scan results.
- Scraped Exploit-DB for exploit availability.

###  Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaned descriptions using **spaCy** and **NLTK**.
- Extracted features: CVSS score, attack vector, exploit availability.
- Generated embeddings using **TF-IDF** and **SBERT**.

### AI Model Training
- Trained classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, fine-tuned **BERT**.
- Output labels: Low, Medium, High, Critical.

### Integration & Interface
- Automated pipeline for scan result ingestion and AI processing.
- GUI using **Streamlit** for interactive usage.

###  Reporting & Visualization
- Dashboard with real-time filtering.
- CVE severity breakdown, exploit availability, patch coverage.

##  Results & Evaluation

### Vulnerability Severity Classification:
| Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|:----------------- |:----------|:----------|:--------|:----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.76     | 0.74     | 0.73   | 0.73     |
| Random Forest       | 0.81     | 0.80     | 0.79   | 0.79     |
| BERT (fine-tuned)   | 0.88     | 0.86     | 0.85   | 0.85     |

### Scan Result Aggregation:
- CVE match rate: **91%**
- False positives: **7%**
- False negatives: **4%**

### Remediation Suggestion Module:
- Direct URL mapping from remediation datasets.
- TF-IDF + NearestNeighbors for semantic suggestions.
- **Gemini LLM** used for generating detailed remediations.
