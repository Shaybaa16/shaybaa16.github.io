I’m **Muhammad Idrees Khan (aka شیبہ)** — a **Penetration Tester and AI Red Teamer** with a strong focus on **offensive security, automation, and vulnerability research**. My work spans **web, network, API, cloud, and AI security**, where I specialize in identifying real-world attack paths and translating them into actionable remediation guidance.

I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity** at **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, Islamabad (Expected April 2025). I enjoy working at the intersection of **practical exploitation, secure system design, and emerging attack surfaces**, particularly in AI-driven systems.

---

## **What I Do**

- **Penetration Testing & Red Teaming**  
  End-to-end web, network, and API security assessments using **OWASP Top 10**, **OWASP API Top 10**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, **PTES**, and **CVSS**-based reporting.

- **AI & LLM Security**  
  Hands-on **AI red teaming**, testing LLMs and autonomous agents for **prompt injection, authorization bypass, logic flaws, and agent exploitation**. I also build intentionally vulnerable AI systems for exploitation demos and security research.

- **Automation & Tooling**  
  Passionate about automating security workflows using **Python, Bash, and PowerShell**—from vulnerability prioritization to cloud misconfiguration detection.

- **DFIR & Threat Intelligence**  
  Experience with **OSINT investigations**, malware analysis workflows, forensic tooling, and incident-response optimization.

## **Experience**

### **AI Red Teamer**
*Hackers Academy — Remote* (Jul 2025 – Sep 2025)
- Performed **AI red-teaming on LLMs and autonomous agents**, identifying **prompt-injection**, **chain-of-thought leakage**, and **authorization bypass** issues.
- Built **intentionally vulnerable AI agents** for exploitation demonstrations and training.
- Automated adversarial testing using **Python fuzzers** and documented findings with **PoCs, threat models, and remediation guidance**.

### **Junior Penetration Tester**
*:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} — Moscow, Russia* (Aug 2024 – Jun 2025)
- Executed **web and network penetration tests**, including **reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and Active Directory exploitation**.
- Assessed applications and infrastructure using **Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, SQLmap, Hydra**, and related tooling.
- Delivered **technical reports with CVSS scoring** and actionable remediation recommendations.

### **Cyber Security Analyst Intern**
*:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} — Remote (UAE)* (Apr 2024 – May 2024)
- Conducted **OSINT and threat-intelligence analysis** to improve organizational security visibility.
- Supported **malware analysis and forensic investigations**.
- Optimized incident-response workflows, **reducing investigation time by 30%**, and maintained the organizational **risk register**.

## **What’s Next?**

I’m currently deepening my expertise in **DevSecOps, cloud security, system security, and advanced red teaming**, while actively participating in **CTFs and security competitions** (Red Team & Blue Team).

I’m always open to **challenging roles and collaborations** in:
- Penetration Testing  
- Security Engineering  
- AI & Cloud Security  
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response  

This blog is where I **document research, publish tools, analyze vulnerabilities, and explore modern attack surfaces**—from classic web exploits to emerging AI threats.
